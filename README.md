## Conclusion

A solo project from Scrimba (all code is from scratch).

The only resource provided was a Figma design file and a 
link to use the OMBb API and the following requirements:

Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html.

Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results.

Button to "add to watchlist" which saves that data to local storage.

Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage.
